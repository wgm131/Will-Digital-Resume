<h3>Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories    May 2024 - August 2024</h3>
<p>
    I’ve worked on optimizing digital logic components in microprocessor-based systems 
    to boost reliability in industrial settings. My experience includes handling applications 
    for fault response and voltage monitoring, as well as leading presentations on integrating 
    software and hardware. I've also provided on-site technical support and training across 
    Mississippi and Louisiana.
</p>
<h3>Asset Engineering    May 2023 - July 2023</h3>
<p>
    I’ve conducted various power system studies, including Load Flow, Short Circuit, 
    Reactive Compensation, Arc Flash, Harmonics, and Relay Coordination, using specialized 
    software to ensure accurate project completion. I also created Protection Single Line 
    diagrams for preliminary packages, collaborating closely with design and drafting teams 
    to meet deadlines efficiently.
