# Bio

  My name is Will McInnis, and I am a senior Electrical Engineering student at Mississippi State University.
  I have prior internship experience with power systems, protective relaying schemes, and microprocessor-based
  digital logic. I am looking for opportunities to combine my knowledge of high-power systems with microwave 
  engineering in a pulsed power role or HPM engineering role.
